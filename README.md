## About Me

- 🔭 I was developer from 2009 to 2017. I am now resuming my career in programming after a 7-year break during which I had non-technical positions in the Web3 industry.
- ⚡ As of February 2025 I am getting back up-to-speed by doing online courses, certifications and hands-on projects.
- 🌱 My latest self-learnings include Typescript, React, React Testing, React Routing, React Native, Redux, NextJS, and AWS.
- 🎮 My hobbies? Movies, music/concerts, kitesurfing, and freediving/apnea.

## Dream Job Wish List

- 👌 My tech stack preference goes for non-compiled typed languages and frameworks that are well established (10y+)
- 👥 Team that's fun, yet professional
- 📱 Product and industry that actually have utility
