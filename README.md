# 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I am resuming my software developer career after a 7-year break during which I had non-technical positions in the web3 industry. I used to be a programmer from 2009 to 2017.

As of February 2025 I kicked this off by doing online courses, certifications and hands-on projects. See below.
